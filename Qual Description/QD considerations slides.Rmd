In terms of the quality of research design, qualitative description has developed a reputation for being low-quality. As Sandelowski (2000, p.334) explained, the hierarchy for evidence-based research values "prediction and control" as the gold standard. As a result, researchers may feel the need to defend their study as being more than a description, and attempt to position their research as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, narrative inquiry, or a case study without actually involving the characteristics of the approach, or engaging in the complex design (Sandelowski, 2000).

"The value of qualitative description lies not only in the knowledge its use can produce, but also as a vehicle for presenting and treating research methods as living entities that resist simple classiÔ¨Åcation."
