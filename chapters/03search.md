<exercise id="1" title="Introduction">
Having already explored the idea of evidence-informed practice and knowledge translation, we will now address the question of how to find research evidence. The focus is on developing systematic and effective approaches to locating and accessing research evidence.  This week we focus on formulating a search question and identifying search terms. 
<br><br>

**The learning objectives are:**
- To develop skills in formulating practice questions to guide a systematic search of the evidence.
-  To develop skills in identifying search terms to guide a systematic search of the evidence.

These [step by step instructions](https://guides.library.utoronto.ca/comprehensivesearching) are also going to be a useful resource for you on formulating a search question. In particular, see the sections entitled “Formulate your Search Question,” “Determine Whether to Search Precisely or Sensitively”, and “ Gather Synonyms for your Search Concepts.”

<exercise id="6" title="Discussion board">

This week each of you will practice the first steps in conducting a search strategy: **developing the search question and defining the search terms.**

Identify an area in your practice that is a source of question or uncertainty -  a situation in which you wondered why you engage in a certain practice or why you were doing what you do with patients/clients or co-workers. Think back to the issues discussed previously in the course for inspiration. Complete the following activity individually and include it as your discussion post this week in your group on teh discussion board in Quercus: 

- Write a short scenario (2-3 sentences) to describe the situation.
- Compose a formal search question (just one) to assist you in locating the evidence to guide practice using PICO as appropriate to your situation: Population, Intervention/exposure/situation, Comparison and Outcome.
- Identify some key search terms you would want to include under each PICO heading as appropriate to your situation.

 Remember to respond to one of your peer’s posts!
