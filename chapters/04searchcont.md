<exercise id="1" title="Introduction">

Following on from learning about how to conduct literature searches using electronic databases in the webinar last week, this week we have an opportunity to practice those skills in preparation for your assignment focusing on this essential requirement for using evidence to inform nursing practice. 

**The learning objectives are:**

- To become familiar with key sources of high quality evidence relevant for addressing nursing and health services practice questions.

-  To develop approaches for systematically and effectively searching bibliographic databases for high quality evidence to address practice questions .

</exercise>

<exercise id="2" title="Reading">

At this point you may wish to first review some of the information first presented last week, by referring back to Chapters 2 and 3 from 'The Evidence-based Practice Manual for Nurses' (Craig, JV & Smyth, RL, 2012) or Chapter 7 of 'The Practice of Nursing Research' (Gray, J.R., Grove, S.K. & Sutherland, S., 2017). 

<qu>This paper below also provides a simple description of the general process you may wish to take when undertaking a literature search.</qu>

<exercise id="3" title="Let's practice">

Time to put what you've learnt into practice.

In the next exercises, we'll be using the Pubmed database (pubmed has mostly the same content as searching Medline in Ovid) to search for research evidence. Everything entered within the quotations is just like entering a search on the Pubmed website.

<br><br>

The first time you enter your search by pressing the 'Submit' button, it will take a little while to load. If the search result hasn't returned after 1 minute - refresh the page. Each subsequent time you press 'Submit' the result will be returned much faster (unless it is idle for >10 minutes).

This first exercise is just a simple practice exercise to demonstrate the process and make sure everything is working right. Have a go at using a MeSH term in a search of the pubmed database. Search for the term 'nursing' and see how many results are returned. 

`Be careful not to remove the line of code reading 'source("search.R")', otherwise the result will not be returned.`

Enter the term in place of the dotted line

<exercise id="4" title="Refining a search">

Now it's time to combine keywords to refine our results. Say we're interested in finding evidence for intentional rounding by nurses, but want to limit the search to less than 50 results. Add in one more search term combined with the boolean operator that reduces the number of results of a search to achieve this.

<codeblock id="01_04">

Enter the boolean operator and search term as well as search tag (eg. [TI] for just the title, [TIAB] for title and abstract) in place of the dotted lines.

</codeblock>

</exercise>

<exercise id="5" title="Synonyms">

In the last exercise we didn't account for the fact that not all studies would have specifically used the term 'intentional rounding'. They may have used other terms like 'hourly rounding', 'nurse rounding' or something completely different. Have a go at broadening the search to hopefully capture other studies that used different phrases to describe this same intervention (i.e. intentional rounding). 

`Note: In pubmed, there are no 'adjacency' operators like nN. Separate words are automatically searched with AND unless the 'wildcard' operator (*) is placed at the end of a word.

<codeblock id="01_05">

- Truncation is represented by the asterisk *, sometimes referred to as a "wildcard". It can be used to search for all terms that begin with that basic word root. 
- Don't forget you can use brackets to group the synonyms. For example: ((nurse) AND (leader* OR manager* OR administrat*)).

</exercise>

<exercise id="6" title="Recap">

Great work. In the previous exercises we have practiced refining a search strategy using the pubmed database. It is important to remember that there are differences between databases in regard to wildcacrd operators, adjacency operators, search tags and filters. So careful consideration of this needs to be taken when searching multiple databases. In the next section, I'm going to be introducing you to a tool that can help you manage the next step of the process in searching the literature - screening through the results of the search!

<exercise id="7" title="Using Covidence to manage search results">

<qu>This is a brief webinar on how to use *Covidence* to manage the process of selecting which of the articles returned from a literature search are relevant to your question.

<exercise id="8" title="Discussion board">

This week you will each practice implementing your search strategy in indexed databases. Using the search terms you identified in Week 3, conduct a search in CINAHL or Medline. Then, post a short description of your search within your assigned group on the discussion board:

- What is your search question?
- How did you combine search terms?
- How effective was your search in locating relevant articles? 
- If your search was not as effective as you anticipated, what strategies do you think would improve the search?
- What did you find (please keep this to 1-2 sentences for sharing the answer to your question)

**Remember to respond to one of your peerâ€™s posts!**
