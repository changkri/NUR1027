<exercise id="1" title="Introduction">

This week we continue our exploration of qualitative research by examining qualitative descriptive research - a design that is commonly used in nursing and health sciences research. 

The aim of Qualitative Description is to describe a phenomenom, or to understand the who, what, where and why of an event or experience.

<exercise id="5" title="Addressing misconceptions">

Sandelowski provides some clarification in these [link] two articles on the common misconceptions of qualitative description, including the theoretical orientation, classification, and data analysis and interpretation of qualiative descriptive research.

Which of these statements is true?<br><br>
<choice>
<opt text="Qualitative descriptive research is atheoretical.">

Although qualitative descriptive research has been described as the 'least theoretical' (Sandelowski, 2000, p.337) of approaches, it is theoretically oriented to naturalism. 

</opt>

<opt text="Qualitative descriptive research is interpretive." correct="true">
qualitative description still 
Good job! As Sandelowski (2010, p.335) states, 'all description requires interpretation'. While in comparison, qualitative descriptive research is less interpretive than other qualitative approaches such as phenomenology or grounded theory, it still requires the researchers to make sense of the data and to 'move somewhere' (p.79).

</opt>

<opt text="Qualitative description has no defining methodological characteristics.">

While it may seem difficult to generalize a methodology for qualitative descriptive studies, as Sandelowski (2010) discusses, there are typical design characteristics such as purposive sampling strategies, open-ended questions guiding individual or focus group interviews for data collection, and the use of some variation of content analysis to interpret the data to produce a descriptive summary.   

</opt>

<opt text="Using a qualitative descriptive approach means that the researcher will not have to analyze or interpret the collected data."
It's important to remember that even with qualitative descriptive research, the data cannot speak for itself and requires the researcher's interpretation of the data to produce a 'presentation of the facts of the case in everyday language' (Sandelowski, 2000, p.335).

<exercise id="8" title="Learning activity">

Please read the following articles and consider the following critical appraisal questions. 


**Critical appraisal questions**


*Are the findings valid?*

1. Is the research question clear and adequately substantiated?
2. Is the design appropriate for the research question?
3. Was the method of sampling appropriate for the research question and design?
4. Were data collected and managed systematically?
5. Were the data analysed appropriately?

*What are the findings?*

1. Is the description of findings thorough?


*How can I apply the findings to patient care?*
1. What meaning and relevance does the study have for my practice?
2. Does the study help me understand the context of my practice?
3. Does the study enhance my knowledge about my practice?
