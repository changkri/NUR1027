<exercise id="11" title="Discussion">

Time to head back to Quercus and participate in the online class <a target="_parent" href="https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/113018/discussion_topics">discussion</a>. This week we'll be using the resource below to structure our discussions in the groups. 

Each of you (individually) are asked to  complete the learning activity outlined below using the Barwick template. Post your response (keep in mind word limits). Review your colleagues’ posts, and respond to at least one post. 

For this week's discussion, consider a practice in your work environment that you think could be improved. What is the current practice, and what is the proposed evidence-informed change? 

Briefly describe the current practice you have identified, and the proposed evidence-informed change. Using the Knowledge Translation Planning Template developed by Melanie Barwick (2013), identify one group of knowledge users for the change (Cell 5 in the template). Then develop a brief main message for this audience (Cell 6 in the template). Formulate 1 KT goal (Cell 7) and identify 1-2 appropriate KT strategies (Cell 8). 

**Remember to respond to one of your peer’s posts!**
