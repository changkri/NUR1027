## Introduction 

This week we continue our exploration of qualitative research by examining qualitative descriptive research - a design that is commonly used in nursing and health sciences research. 

The aim of Qualitative Description is to describe a phenomenom, or to understand the who, what, where and why of an event or experience. 

While we'll discuss the many advantages to using this approach, you'll see that it's flexibility in design can make it challenging to define in terms of specific characteristics or methods.


## Objectives

- Understand and critique qualitative descriptive design and its fundamental features and characteristics.
- Critically appraise and interpret findings from qualitative descriptive studies and consider relevance to practice. 


## Generic Qualitative Research

To review, generic qualitative research doesn't conform to any of the established qualitative approaches (Kahlke, 2014). Caelli et al. (2003, p.2) defines generic qualitative research as qualitative research that's "not guided by an explicit or established set of philosphic assumptions in the form of one of the known qualitative methodlogies".

Qualitative description and interpretive description are considered "subcategories" of generic qualitative research (Kahlke, 2014, p.37). 

It's important to recognize the distinction between the two (qualitative description and interpretive description). The intent of qualitative description is to stay close to the data to produce a descriptive summary that is communicated in the informant's everyday language (Sandelowski, 2000; Neergaard et al., 2009). With interpretive description, producing a description alone is insufficient. Rather, the researcher should produce a "coherent conceptual description" that provides greater theoretical knowledge, and explores clinical patterns or structural observations of the clinical phenomena of interest with implications to practice (Thorne et al., 2004, p. 4).    


## Qualitative Description
It's not always reasonable for clinician researchers to conduct "deeply theoretical and methodoloigcally sophisticated" qualitative studies, but that shouldn't deter them from engaging in qualitative research that maintains "thoughtful and rigorous inquiry" (Caelli et al., 2003, p.2).  

The complex components of distinct qualitative approaches like phenomenology, ethnography, grounded theory, narrative or case study makes qualitative description an appealing approach for nursing research (Sandelowski, 2000).

Sandelowski (2000, p.335) explains that qualitative description is it's own research method, rather than a "nursing adaptation of grounded theory, phenomenology, and ethnography".

## Considerations
In terms of the quality of research design, qualitative description has developed a reputation for being low-quality. As Sandelowski (2000, p.334) explained, the hierarchy for evidence-based research values "prediction and control" as the gold standard. As a result, researchers may feel the need to defend their study as being more than a description, and attempt to position their research as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, narrative inquiry, or a case study without actually involving the characteristics of the approach, or engaging in the complex design (Sandelowski, 2000).
