<exercise id="2" title="Course description">

A major responsibility for masters-prepared advanced practiced nurses in leadership roles (formal or informal) is promoting evidence-informed practice and policy decisions within nursing. In order to be successful in this endeavour, nurses must be knowledgeable consumers of nursing and related (e.g. health services and social sciences) research. This course and the subsequent course NUR1127 will further develop your knowledge, skill, and judgment related to research competencies for advanced practice nurses as outlined in the [Canadian Nurses’ Association document “Advanced Practice Nursing: A Pan-Canadian Framework (2019)”](https://cna-aiic.ca/en/nursing-practice/the-practice-of-nursing/advanced-nursing-practice). 

The focus of NUR1027 is on critical examination and reflection on research and evidence-informed practice, with an emphasis on integration of theory and research to guide practice. You will develop an understanding of the philosophical foundations of contemporary approaches to knowledge production in nursing and the health sciences, and essential competencies in locating, interpreting, critiquing, and using research evidence in practice. Critical analysis of both qualitative and quantitative approaches and their underlying theoretical frameworks will enable you to understand and appropriately integrate research into practice.

</exercise>

<exercise id="3" title="Course objectives">

*The overall objectives of the course are to enable students to:*

- Appreciate the integral role of research evidence in informing nursing practice.
- Understand the development of major approaches to knowledge production in the health sciences (philosophy of science.)
- Situate qualitative and quantitative modes of inquiry within their respective ontological and epistemological foundations.
- Understand the relationship between the philosophical foundations of different research designs and approaches, and apply criteria for assessing rigour (truth value) of these designs and approaches.
- Cultivate a sensitivity to, and appreciation of, the complexity and diversity of nursing research approaches relevant to leadership and health services.

*Specifically, students will develop the ability to:*

- Critically appraise and use frameworks and strategies to support evidence-informed practice and knowledge translation.
- Formulate clear, specific questions about health care practice that can be addressed with research evidence.
- Plan and execute a systematic search to locate evidence to answer practice questions.
- Critically appraise and interpret descriptive research studies that employ different approaches.

<exercise id="7" title="Discussion group">

Participation in an asynchronous discussion group, found by clicking on "Discussions" in Quercus will give you an opportunity for further clarification and commentary on the key concepts and learning activities, through dialogue with your classmates, professor and teaching assistant. It is expected that students will regularly respond to questions and comments posed on the discussion board, and that posts will develop increasing depth and sophistication as the course progresses.

</exercise>

<exercise id="8" title="Online activities">

In addition to independent learning activities, there will be regular online group activities designed to create learning synergies, extend your critical thinking about the course material, and build a sense of community among students. 

</exercise>

<exercise id="9" title="Working in an online environment">

How do I work and learn in an online environment?
The online environment provides increased flexibility in terms of when and where you engage in learning activities. However it can also present challenges, requiring a degree of self-discipline to ensure you are able to take advantage of group discussions and learn from the observations and insights of your colleagues, as well as the course faculty. Here are some tips to help you be successful in engaging in on-line learning:

- This is a relatively self-directed learning environment, so it is important to manage your time carefully.
- As is the case in all graduate programs (both in-class and on-line), the course requires a considerable amount of independent study, guided by the resources and learning activities provided each week. Be sure to complete the weekly learning activities, and to participate in the Discussion every week. This is where we will work through together any questions you have about the material you are studying.
- Organize your time to ensure that you can complete the weekly reading and other learning activities on time. It is critical that you do not get behind. 
- While completing the weekly learning activities, compile a list of questions or concerns that arise so that you can seek help via your colleagues on the discussion board.

</exercise>

<exercise id="10" title="Course time commitment">

Most students will need a **minimum 8-10 hours/week** to complete the readings and learnings activities and participate in the discussion group.  **Additional time** will be required to complete assignments.

</exercise>

<exercise id="11" title="Writing resources">

We strongly recommend a visit to the [University of Toronto Writing Centre Website](http://writing.utoronto.ca/). This website has a wealth of information regarding academic writing including information about writing when English is not your first language, writing courses and workshops available for students, and information about using other Writing Centres at the University of Toronto.

<exercise id="16" title="Course participation">

The Quercus Discussion Board is our virtual classroom. This is where we will engage in discussion and clarification of the course material, and practise applying course concepts. In order to make the most of this opportunity, we need to allow time for these asynchronous discussions to unfold over the week. Thus it is important that you go join the discussions several times over the week, rather than posting only at the end of the week.
To facilitate discussion there will be a number of questions posed each week. It is important that all students participate in these discussions. I ask that you please keep your postings succinct **(maximum 200 words (text) or 2 minutes audio/video)** so that others have an opportunity to respond as well. Postings must be presented in your own words and reflect a critical analysis and interpretation of course material, exercises, and other learning activities.  You are encouraged to share insights into the application and use of course concepts in practice. Please include relevant references in your posts (not included in the word count).
Students are expected to read assigned material for each week and respond to each other’s postings and questions.  The minimum expectation is that you submit one posting of your own and provide a short but substantive response to at least one other student’s post each week.


*Relevance and Content*

The student:

-	Comments and questions and thoughtfully addresses the topic and question.
-	Demonstrates s/he has read the discussion and has taken the discussion into consideration before posting.
-	Contributes new ideas (e.g., new perspectives, examples) in integrating relevant readings.
-	Makes connections between ideas (e.g., connects concepts, explains similarities).
-	Applies and rephrases ideas from previous classes accurately and appropriately.
-	Asks questions that promote in-depth discussion.

*Tone and Clarity*

-	Tone is respectful, friendly and professional.
-	Proofreads comments for clarity before posting.
-	Communicates ideas in a professional but engaging way.
-	Addresses other students by name.
-	Humour, emotions, and colloquial language, if used at all, are used sparingly and with sensitivity to other students.
-	Responds to other students as well as the instructor.

*Netiquette*

Certain rules of etiquette are also recommended for online discussions (Netiquette). These include:

- Always be courteous to other students
- Before introducing a new topic area, search to see if a similar discussion point already exists
- Stay on-topic
- Avoid the use of all CAPTIAL LETTERS in posts. ALL CAPS is considered shouting
