    "description": "The focus of NUR1027 is on critical examination and reflection on research and evidence-informed practice, with an emphasis on integration of theory and research to guide practice. You will develop an understanding of the philosophical foundations of contemporary approaches to knowledge production in nursing and the health sciences, and essential competencies in locating, interpreting, critiquing, and using research evidence in practice. Critical analysis of both qualitative and quantitative approaches and their underlying theoretical frameworks will enable you to understand and appropriately integrate research into practice.",
