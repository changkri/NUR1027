# Critiques of evidence-based practice

<img  src="rycroft.png">

Notes: Now I'd like to talk about the risks associated with evidence-based practice because there are in fact several to consider. One such ‘side effect’ of the rise in importance of ‘evidence-based practice’ has been termed, evidence-based paralysis. You may have had this experience before where you have a clinical question and you go to the evidence to look for the perfect evidence and lo and behold it doesn't exist. Despite all this effort you’re left with no answer at all and therefore paralyzed in your decision-making. Another important thing to keep in mind is that there is no perfect evidence. All we have to deal with is the best available evidence at any given time and sometimes the best available evidence may just be expert opinion. A second major risk with evidence-based medicine is being taken in by the latest and greatest research and changing your whole approach to treatment based on one you study. I think it's really important to take a look at all studies that are done on a topic and for this reason, a great source of information is always looking to systematic reviews, or rigorously conducted evidence summaries, such as those produced by the Joanna Briggs Institute. A final important consideration for evidence-based practice is being careful when presenting our views for how we think research should be used in practice. Who you are, where you work and who you work with may be very different than others and, because of these differing experiences,the results and finsings of research studies may mean something different to them.
