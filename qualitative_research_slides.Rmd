## Introduction 

This week we continue our exploration of qualitative research by examining qualitative descriptive research - a design that is commonly used in nursing and health sciences research. 

The aim of Qualitative Description is to describe a phenomenom, or to understand the who, what, where and why of an event or experience. 

Although we'll discuss the many advantages to using this approach, you'll see that it's flexibility in design can make it challenging to define in terms of specific characteristics or methods.
